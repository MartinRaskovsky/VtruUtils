Protocol for Working with Dr. Martín Raskovsky
Date: April 2025

Overview:
This protocol ensures consistency, accuracy, and version control during collaboration with Dr. Martín Raskovsky on codebase updates. It applies across all components and modules.

Key Practices:

1. Source of Truth:
   - The user (Dr. Raskovsky) is the definitive source of the latest code.
   - Always request the current version before making any changes, unless just shared.

2. Edit Format:
   - Provide full-file rewrites unless explicitly told to do otherwise.
   - All rewritten files must be copy-paste friendly for Visual Studio Code.

3. Context Awareness:
   - Do not assume past file states are still valid unless confirmed by the user.
   - Do not retain state across sessions unless explicitly instructed.

4. File Saving:
   - Do not auto-save or persist any files unless explicitly requested.
   - If a persistent reminder is needed, a downloadable file will be provided.

5. Universal Application:
   - This protocol is to be applied to all components (React, Perl, JS, etc.).
   - Always clarify assumptions and double-check file versions before edits.

Usage:
Upload this file at the start of a session to reinstate collaboration rules. Ensure these are followed exactly.
